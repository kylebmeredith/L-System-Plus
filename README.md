# L System Plus

A reusable TouchDesigner component and demo file for creating procedurally generated plants with L Systems. The L System Plus tox adds a host of new functionality to the basic L System SOP, including separate materials for each piece of geometry and customizable instancing for leaves.

The component is free to use and modify, though I ask that you credit me when you use it :)

Check out my [L-System tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCwExvLf8DQ) for more info. 

I created this component for the Boreal Oasis, an interactive installation I created in collaboration with Vanishworks ([learn more](https://www.kyle-meredith.com/single-post/the-boreal-oasis)).
